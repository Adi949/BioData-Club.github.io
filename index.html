     excerpt: "BioData Club is an informal community at OHSU dedicated to promoting a fun and supportive culture of interdisciplinary
    co-learning in data science skills and open science principles. We host workshops, along with social events where you
    can work on personal projects among friends. We welcome everyone at all skill levels who aim to better their skills in
    all things data. We want to replace statistics anxiety and code fear with inspiration and motivation to learn and
    share.<br><br>"

  - title: "Events"
    excerpt: "BioData Clubs host two types of events:  practical learning workshops and hacky hours, often linked by a shared theme.  Hacky hours are for networking.
