Everyone is welcome, no experience required!

Bring a laptop and your own dataset and we’ll set you up to explore your data with burro (http://laderast.github.io/burro), which lets you explore your data with an easy to use app. 

Or if there’s a public dataset that looks interesting to explore, send us a link (laderast@ohsu.edu) and we’ll set up an app to look at it together. 

## Setup

If you have time, please sign up for an account on RStudio Cloud: http://rstudio.cloud 

We'll run the `burro` app from here.
