description: "R and ggplot2 are tools for making impactful data visualizations.  Some may fear the “code” learning curve, but with ggplot2’s “grammar of graphics” the syntax becomes intuitive and builds on itself. This workshop aims to introduce beginners to practical hands-on examples that can be applied to one’s own data analyses. Experienced users will have the opportunity to test their knowledge and learn new tricks and technique. Come to this workshop to improve your research exploration and communication skills with instructors Kevin Watanabe-Smith and Emile Latour."
